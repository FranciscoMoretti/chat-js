Print the fully resolved configuration for the current ChatJS project. Defaults from `applyDefaults` are merged into your `chat.config.ts`, and the result is printed as JSON.

```bash
npx @chat-js/cli@latest config [options]
```

## Options

| Flag              | Default | Description                                            |
| ----------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `-c, --cwd <cwd>` | `cwd`   | The working directory (defaults to current directory). |

## How it works

The command spawns a short-lived process using your package manager inside your project directory that:

1. Imports your `chat.config.ts`
2. Passes it through `applyDefaults` from `@/lib/config-schema`
3. Prints the result as formatted JSON to stdout

This means the output always reflects the effective configuration your app will use at runtime, including any defaults that are not explicitly set in `chat.config.ts`.

## Example

```bash
npx @chat-js/cli@latest config
```

```json
{
  "appName": "My Chat App",
  "gateway": {
    "provider": "vercel",
    "model": "gpt-4o"
  },
  "features": {
    "webSearch": false,
    "imageGeneration": false
  },
  "auth": {
    "providers": ["github"]
  }
}
```

Run from a different directory:

```bash
npx @chat-js/cli@latest config --cwd ./apps/chat
```
